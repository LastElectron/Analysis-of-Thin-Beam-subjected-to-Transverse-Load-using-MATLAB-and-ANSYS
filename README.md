## __Problem Statement:__

Write a MATLAB code for the given beam made of three different materials subjected to transverse load of 500N using Finite Element Analysis.

![FEM FINAL REPORT_1_PART2 (corrected after submission)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9f18d2-0b06-44cc-b0e6-dbda92b0995b)

The thickness of the beam is **t = 1 mm**. The material properties are as follows: 
- **E<sub>1</sub> = 25 GPa**
- **E<sub>2</sub> = 50 GPa**
- **E<sub>3</sub> = 100 GPa**. 

A uniform Poisson’s ratio of **ν = 0.3** is assumed.
