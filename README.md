## __Problem Statement:__

Write a MATLAB code for the given beam made of three different materials subjected to transverse load of 500N using Finite Element Analysis.

The thickness of the beam is \( t = 1 \, \text{mm} \). The material properties are as follows: \( E_1 = 25 \, \text{GPa} \), \( E_2 = 50 \, \text{GPa} \), and \( E_3 = 100 \, \text{GPa} \). A uniform Poissonâ€™s ratio of \( \nu = 0.3 \) is assumed.
